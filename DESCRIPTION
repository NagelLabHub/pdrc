Description: 
    `pdrc` provides a collection of tools for processing and analyzing 
    high-throughput DNA repair capacity (DRC) measurements in population-based studies. 
    This package supports data standardization, batch effect correction, regression 
    model fitting, and visualization to facilitate large-scale epidemiological 
    and biomarker studies of DNA repair.
