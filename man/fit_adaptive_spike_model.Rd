\usage{
fit_adaptive_spike_model(data, bio_penalty = 4, complexity_penalty = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with 'time' and 'F_t' columns.}

\item{bio_penalty}{Numeric; penalty applied for biologically implausible models (default = 3).}

\item{complexity_penalty}{Numeric; penalty per additional model term (default = 2).}
}
\value{
A list containing the best model, model scores, and flags for spike detection and short follow-up.
}
\description{
Fit multiple decay models (fast decay, slow decay, accumulation) and select the best model based on LOOIC, spike detection, biological penalties, and model complexity.
